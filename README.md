# hantaflow
Nextflow pipeline for the analysis of Hantavirus (and related) genomes generated using amplicon-based approaches

## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO : Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC and trimming ([`FastP`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp))
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
3. Genome assembly ([`Spades`](https://github.com/ablab/spades))
4. Sort amplicons 
5. Rearrange amplicons
